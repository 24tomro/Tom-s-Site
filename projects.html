    <p class = "p">Some projects I have completed over the years, are the I-Search report in my freshamn year, and ceramics in my Freshman year. While writing the I-Searcb my freshman year, I did a project about Cystic Fibrosis, which i the disease my sister has. It was really just about infroming people about CF, and I was really proud of it. I was also proud of my ceramcis in my freshan year, as I give them to my mom as gifts. </p>
